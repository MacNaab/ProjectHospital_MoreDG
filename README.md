# More diagnostics

## Adds new diagnostics in base game departments.

### Description :

Is your hospital functioning well ? You are starting to get bored but you don't want to add new departments ? This mod is for you! It adds many new diagnoses, symptoms, exams, treatments in the five departments of the basic game.

Updates will be monthly or bimonthly. Refer to the roadmap to see the progress.
I recommend using this mod at the end game, when all departments are unlocked with hospitalization, because some diagnoses will require heavy support by your healthcare teams.

**Currently present :**
|    | Deparment  | New diagnostic  | Unique diagnostic | Trauma |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Cardiology  | Cardiology department  | 25  | 25  | 7  |
| Endocrinology  | Internal medicine department  | 19 | 14 | 3 |
| Endocrinology  | General Surgery department  | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| Hematology (benign)  | Internal medicine department  | 37 | 28 | 5 |

**Introducing a new mecanic :**
- Some symptoms will require a medical care in another department (change manually)
For exemple : one of the complications of mesenteric ischemia (cardiology) requires surgical management by General Surgery


### Roadmap :
- Nutrition : work in progress (it'll be nutritional deficiency)
- Internal medecine : testing phase (24 diagnostics)
- Pneumology : testing phase (20 diagnostics)
- Rhumatology : work in progress (11 diagnostics)
And more !
